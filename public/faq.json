      "question": "What is the difference between a recipe and a cooking instruction?",
      "answer": "A recipe is a set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including the ingredients and quantities needed, as well as the steps involved in cooking. Cooking instructions are more general and can apply to a variety of dishes. For example, a recipe for chocolate chip cookies might include instructions for measuring and mixing the ingredients, baking the cookies, and letting them cool. Cooking instructions on how to bake cookies might include general tips on how to choose the right ingredients, how to preheat the oven, and how to check for doneness."
